# Work In Progress


## Feature

When I see a potential match, I want to know how far they are relative to my position, so I can decide if this potential match is between my personal preverences.

Things to have in mind
* Some people don't want to share their exact location
* Some devices may not be compatible with the Geolocation API

**MVP**
* get an location of the user
* get location of potential match out of the DB
* compare those locations
* return distance between locations

Improvements of the **MVP**
* alternative to GEO API
